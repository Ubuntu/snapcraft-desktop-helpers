# Snapcraft Desktop Helpers

Graphical applications need additional libraries and environment configuration to function correctly inside a snap. The snapcraft desktop helpers project contains a number of tools to make this easier. For example, several environment variables and compatibility symlinks are setup in the [desktop-launch wrapper](https://github.com/ubuntu/snapcraft-desktop-helpers/blob/master/common/desktop-exports) to help ensure the snap can find needed files.

## How to use the desktop helpers

Read the documentation on [snapping graphical applications](https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/desktop-applications/13034) for more information on how to use these desktop helpers.
